		<h1 class='mat-display-4'>Documentation for Participants</h1>
		<p>This section outlines how to use the RCTrials project by participants looking to download the app, register in a trial, and submit survey responses.</p>
		<hr/>

		<h2 class='mat-h2'><span id='install'></span>Installing the app</h2>
		<div class='p_row'>
			<div class='p_col'>
				<p>To download the <em>RCTrials App</em> participants need to visit the <a href='//rctrials.intefacemaster.ca'>rctrials.interfacemaster.ca</a> site.</p>
				<p>Because the project is still in <i>Beta</i> the app is not available through the Google Play store and must be downloaded directly from the site.</p>
				<p>Most Android devices are configured to prevent installation of unsigned packages by default, so you may need to change your settings accordingly to allow the installation of this app.</p>

		<h2 class='mat-h2'><span id='register'></span>Registering with a trial</h2>
		<div class='p_row'>
			<div class='p_col'>
				<p>To register with a trial, first open the RCTrials App. If this is your first time opening the app, you will see the "Set Up" button, which will take you to the setup screen where you can enter your Trial ID. Alternatively, if you have already registered with another trial, you can use the menu icon (&#8801;) and select the "Register in a New Trial" button to access the setup screen.</p>
				<p>The Trial ID should be provided to you by the researcher(s) and is a four-digit alphanumeric code.</p>

		<h2 class='mat-h2'><span id='submit'></span>Submitting survey responses</h2>
		<div class='p_row'>
			<div class='p_col'>
				<p>Submitting survey responses is easy. When you log into the app click the "Check" button. This will check whether any surveys are available for you and display them in a list below.</p>
				<p>To fill out a survey select it from the list. You will be presented with each question in the survey as a separate screen. If you wish to leave an answer blank, you can press the "Next" button. Continue pressing "Next" until you have finished answering all the questions and click "Finish". Your anonymous responses will be sent to RCTrials.</p>
				<p>If you do not finish answering a survey and "Cancel" out, your responses will be stored locally on the device until you are ready to resume the survey. Once all the answers are entered, the results will be sent to RCTrials.</p>
